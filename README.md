# Mechanical Noggles

Welcome to the Mechanical Noggles project! This repository contains the files for creating mechanical noggles, both in their manual version and with a motorized base. Designed with versatility in mind, these noggles can be assembled, customized, and improved upon by anyone.

The project is released under the CC0 license, encouraging the community to freely use, adapt, and enhance the designs. You'll find all the necessary files in STL and STEP formats, making it easy to get started with your own creations.


## Overview

Mechanical Noggles is an open-source project that provides all the necessary files to create your own mechanical noggles. This project includes:

- Manual version noggles
- Motorized base version noggles

The designs are freely available under the CC0 license, meaning you can use, modify, and distribute them without any restrictions.

## Files Provided

- **STL Files**: For 3D printing the components.
- **STEP Files**: For further customization and modification in CAD software.
